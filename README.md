# Gender Life Expectancy Gap and Happiness Levels

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the relationship between the difference in life expectancy between men and women and the overall happiness levels in various countries. The hypothesis being tested is: **"Countries where women live significantly longer than men tend to have higher happiness levels."** By examining this relationship, the project seeks to explore potential societal or health-related factors that may contribute to both longevity differences and subjective well-being.

## Data Sources
The study will use the following datasets:
- **Life Expectancy Data:** Provides the average life expectancy for men and women in various countries.
- **Happiness Index Data:** Contains happiness scores or percentages for countries, reflecting the overall well-being of the population.
- **Additional Societal and Health Factors (if applicable):** If available, secondary data on health habits (e.g., smoking, physical activity, marital status) may be used to provide deeper insights into contributing factors.

## Data Collection Plan
The datasets will be collected from publicly available sources such as:
- **Kaggle Life Expectancy Dataset:** [Life Expectancy Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ignacioazua/life-expectancy)
- **Kaggle World Happiness Dataset:** [World Happiness Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/unsdsn/world-happiness)
- Other reliable research institutions or government reports for additional health-related factors.
- If necessary, data cleaning and merging processes will be conducted to ensure consistency between datasets.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Calculate the difference in life expectancy between men and women for each country.
2. **Grouping Countries:**
   - Divide countries into two groups based on whether the gender life expectancy gap is above or below the average.
3. **Statistical Analysis:**
   - Conduct an independent samples t-test to determine if there is a statistically significant difference in happiness scores between these two groups.
4. **Correlation Analysis:**
   - Examine the strength and direction of the relationship between gender life expectancy differences and happiness levels.
5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Various visualization techniques will be explored to best represent the relationship between life expectancy differences and happiness levels.

## Expected Outcomes
The study aims to determine whether a significant relationship exists between gender-based life expectancy differences and national happiness levels. Possible outcomes include:
- **A positive correlation**, supporting the hypothesis.
- **No significant correlation**, indicating other dominant factors influencing happiness.
- **A negative correlation** (though unlikely), suggesting alternative explanations.

## Conclusion
This project has the potential to contribute valuable insights into the relationship between demographic factors and happiness. Understanding these patterns can help policymakers address longevity disparities and improve well-being on a national scale.
